# TODO

_The problem I want to solve is to try and group a large amount of test cases, which now are located in a flat directory structure i.e. not organized at all. So, based of what each test (which may consist of several Lux files) is testing it would be nice to group test together that test similar or related things. Note that Lux tests are very similar to expect based tests. Any ideas of how to do this?_

Given the nature of your problem and the structure of Lux tests, here are some alternative approaches you could consider:

## 1. Use Topic Modeling Techniques

Instead of K-means clustering, you could use topic modeling techniques like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). This might better capture the underlying themes in your tests.

```python
   from gensim import corpora
   from gensim.models import LdaModel
   
   # Create a dictionary and corpus
   dictionary = corpora.Dictionary(processed_docs)
   corpus = [dictionary.doc2bow(doc) for doc in processed_docs]
   
   # Train the model
   lda_model = LdaModel(corpus=corpus, id2word=dictionary, num_topics=10)
   
   # Assign topics to documents
   doc_topics = [lda_model.get_document_topics(bow) for bow in corpus]
```

## 2. Hierarchical Clustering

This could provide a tree-like structure of test similarities, allowing you to choose the level of granularity.

```python
   from scipy.cluster.hierarchy import linkage, dendrogram
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   
   # Perform hierarchical clustering
   linkage_matrix = linkage(tfidf_matrix.toarray(), method='ward')
   
   # Plot dendrogram
   dendrogram(linkage_matrix)
   plt.show()
```

## 3. Feature Engineering

Extract more meaningful features from your Lux tests. For example:


   * Command patterns used in the tests
   * Types of assertions made
   * Specific configuration elements being tested

   ```python
   def extract_features(lux_content):
       features = {
           'uses_shell_command': 'shell' in lux_content,
           'checks_config': 'config' in lux_content,
           'performs_restconf': 'restconf' in lux_content,
           # Add more relevant features
       }
       return features
   
   test_features = [extract_features(test) for test in test_contents]
   ```

   ## 4. Similarity-based Grouping

   Instead of clustering, you could compute pairwise similarities and group tests that are above a certain similarity threshold.

```python
   from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity
   
   # Compute pairwise similarities
   similarities = cosine_similarity(tfidf_matrix)
   
   # Group similar tests
   groups = []
   for i, test in enumerate(test_names):
       similar_tests = [test_names[j] for j in range(len(test_names)) if similarities[i][j] > 0.5]
       groups.append(similar_tests)
```

## 5. Combine Multiple Approaches

Use a combination of these methods. For example, you could use topic modeling to identify main themes, then within each theme use hierarchical clustering for finer-grained grouping.

## 6. Manual Keyword Extraction

If you have domain expertise, you could manually define a set of keywords or patterns that are indicative of different test types or functionalities. Then group tests based on the presence of these keywords.

```python
   keywords = {
       'network': ['interface', 'routing', 'switch'],
       'security': ['firewall', 'encryption', 'authentication'],
       # Add more categories and keywords
   }
   
   def categorize_test(test_content):
       categories = []
       for category, words in keywords.items():
           if any(word in test_content for word in words):
               categories.append(category)
       return categories
   
   test_categories = [categorize_test(test) for test in test_contents]
```


Remember to preprocess your test content effectively, removing common boilerplate code or irrelevant parts that might introduce noise into your analysis.


These approaches might help you get more meaningful groupings based on the actual content and purpose of your Lux tests. You may need to experiment with different combinations to find what works best for your specific set of tests.
